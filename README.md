# Code-Wars
My completed katas on Code Wars

Goals:
* add any katas I've completed on a weekly basis, as well as get any old ones I've completed uploaded as well. 
* (Long term) figure out a more automated way to do this. Their API doesn't look very promising though

Changes:
* 02.10.2016 - Added repository, added some completed katas. 

* 03.09.2016 - Added more completed katas.
